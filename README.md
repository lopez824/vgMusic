# vgMusic
Web Development Project for Computer Science 401 at Boise State University.

My website is quite simple. No login is required and it currently has the core functionality I wanted.

## TODO:
* Update CSS.
* Add more songs to database.
* Add a login, perhaps store favorite songs.
* Perhaps change submission form from buttons to text input, if I have time.
