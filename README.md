# vgMusic
Web Development Project for Computer Science 401 at Boise State University.

The purpose of this site is to suggest video game music to people, based on some moods.

My website is quite simple. No login is required and it currently has the core functionality I wanted. Works best if you are logged into Spotify via the browser before visiting the site. Otherwise the song selections will only be 30 second previews.
